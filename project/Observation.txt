Methodology & Results
We developed a Random Forest model using WhoTracksMe data to predict website trackers based on various features including popularity, bad_qs, and other website characteristics. During model development, we implemented several optimization strategies:

Feature Selection:

Employed feature importance analysis to effectively reduce dimensionality

Maintained model performance while significantly improving training efficiency

Without dimensionality reduction, grid search operations would require hundreds of hours

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Conducted comprehensive grid search optimization

Improved micro F1-score from 0.89 to 0.90

Identified optimal parameter combinations for prediction accuracy

Data Analysis:

Verified that simply increasing data volume without quality improvement didn't enhance performance

Regularly validated model against WhoTracksMe's updated datasets

Maintained consistent evaluation metrics across data refreshes

Limitations & Future Work
Our analysis revealed several important limitations:

Novel Tracker Prediction:
The model cannot effectively predict:

Emergence of new tracker types

Emerging tracking trends in the dataset

Temporal Pattern Recognition:
The current architecture lacks capability to:

Identify temporal patterns in tracker adoption

Detect evolving tracking strategies

Recommended Improvements:

Implementation of RNN or other sequential models for temporal analysis

Development of hybrid architectures combining traditional ML with deep learning

Enhanced feature engineering to capture trend-related patterns

Conclusion
While our Random Forest implementation achieved satisfactory performance (F1=0.90) for known tracker prediction, the study highlights the need for more sophisticated approaches to address the dynamic nature of web tracking technologies. Future work should focus on temporal modeling architectures to better capture evolving tracking behaviors.
